    <h1>PythonFullStack</h1>
    <p>You're knee deep in learning Python programming. The syntax is starting to make sense. The first few ahh-ha! moments 
        hit you as you learn to use conditional statements, for loops and classes while coding 
        with the open source libraries that make Python such an amazing programming ecosystem.</p>

    <p>Now you want to take your initial Python knowledge and make something real, like a
        web application to show off to friends or sell as a service to customers. 
        That's where Full Stack Python comes in. You have come to the right place to learn everything you need to create, 
        deploy and operate Python-powered applications.</p>
        
    <p>Full Stack Python is an open source book that explains technical concepts in plain language. 
        Read everything online for free or purchase the Supporter's Edition for nicely-formatted ebook (PDF, EPUB, MOBI) versions. 
        This guide branches out on topic because your learning requirements depend on what you're working on.
